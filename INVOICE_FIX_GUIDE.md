# Invoice Generation Error Fix Guide

## Problem
Getting error: "Could not find the function public.generate_invoice_number without parameters in the schema cache"

## Root Cause
The database migrations containing the `generate_invoice_number()` function haven't been applied to your Supabase instance.

## Solutions (Choose ONE)

### Option 1: Quick Fix - Apply Database Function (RECOMMENDED)
1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard: https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Sign in and select your project: `bcgbtaxhbthpqrhazdxc`
3. Navigate to "SQL Editor" in the sidebar
4. Copy and paste the content from `fix-invoice-function.sql` (created in your project root)
5. Click "Run" to execute the SQL
6. Try creating an invoice again - it should work now!

### Option 2: Code-Level Fallback (ALREADY IMPLEMENTED)
I've already modified your `useInvoices.ts` hook to include a fallback mechanism:
- If the database function exists, it will use it
- If the function is missing, it will generate invoice numbers locally
- This provides a seamless experience regardless of database state

## What Was Fixed
- Added local invoice number generation as fallback
- Improved error handling for missing database functions
- Added console warnings for debugging
- Maintains the same INV-XXXX format

## Testing
1. Try creating an invoice now - it should work with the fallback
2. After applying the database function (Option 1), future invoices will use the database function
3. Invoice numbers will be sequential (INV-0001, INV-0002, etc.)

## Files Modified
- `src/hooks/useInvoices.ts` - Added fallback invoice number generation
- `fix-invoice-function.sql` - SQL script to create the missing function

## Next Steps
1. Apply the database function using Option 1 for optimal performance
2. Test invoice creation in your application
3. Verify invoice numbers are generated correctly
